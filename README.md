# Causal Analysis of the Impact of Resource Utilisation on Decisions in a Process

This repository contains the code and results for the manuscript "The Effects of Resource Utilisation on Decisions in Processes" submitted to Information Systems. 
The core question is whether the resource utilisation at a choice point in a process model has a causal effect on which path is taken.

---

## Overview

The pipeline takes an enriched multi-run as input, and then runs causal machine learning (Double ML + Causal Forest) to test whether utilisation is a significant driver of routing choices.

Five process discovery algorithms are compared as miners:

| Miner                        | ID          |
|------------------------------|-------------|
| Directly-Follows Graph       | `dfg-miner` |
| Flower model                 | `flw-miner` |
| Inductive Miner              | `im-miner`  | 
| Inductive Miner infrequent   | `imf-miner` |

## Input data

> **⚠ The enriched multi-run and discovered model files (`input/`) are too large for this repository.**
>
> Download them from: https://figshare.com/s/0b988968c58a48fd7794
>
> Extract the archive so that the folder structure matches:
> ```
> input/3-executions-per-miner/dfg-miner/*.exs
> input/3-executions-per-miner/flw-miner/*.exs
> input/3-executions-per-miner/im-miner/*.exs
> ...
> ```
> Each `.exs` file has a companion `.exs.time` file recording how long the replay took.



### Datasets

The following public event logs from the [4TU Research Data repository](https://data.4tu.nl/) were used:

| Log | Short name used in filenames |
|---|---|
| BPI Challenge 2017 — Offer log | `BPI Challenge 2017 - Offer log` |
| BPI Challenge 2013 — Closed problems | `BPI_Challenge_2013_closed_problems` |
| BPI Challenge 2013 — Incidents | `BPI_Challenge_2013_incidents` |
| BPI Challenge 2013 — Open problems | `BPI_Challenge_2013_open_problems` |
| BPIC 2012-a | `bpic12-a` |
| BPIC 2018 Parcel document | `bpic18 Parcel document` |

## Setup

**Requires Python 3.10.**

```bash
python3.10 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install pm4py==2.7.22.2 pandas numpy scipy scikit-learn econml causalml \
            matplotlib seaborn openpyxl jupyterlab ebi-pm
```

Key package versions used during development:

| Package | Version |
|---|---|
| pm4py | 2.7.22.2 |
| pandas | 2.3.3 |
| numpy | 2.2.6 |
| econml | 0.16.0 |
| causalml | 0.15.5 |
| ebi-pm | 0.3.11 |
| scipy | 1.15.3 |
| seaborn | 0.13.2 |

## Running the pipeline

1. Ensure the input data is in place (see "Input data" above).
2. Launch JupyterLab:
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   jupyter lab
   ```
3. Open and run **`pipeline_per_miner.ipynb`** — this iterates over all three miners and all datasets, writes per-dataset Excel/PDF reports to `output/{miner}/`, and appends a row to `output/feasibility_study.csv`.

### Analysis notebooks

| Notebook | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `visualizations.ipynb` | Resource utilisation histograms; saves PDFs for the overall distribution and BPI 2017 dfg |
| `correlation_analysis.ipynb` | Pearson correlation matrix of dataset size metrics vs. computation times; saves `output/correlation_matrix.pdf` |

### Key output files

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `output/feasibility_study.csv` | One row per dataset × miner: counts, timing per pipeline step |
| `output/compute_times.xlsx` | All `.exs.time` values from all input folders |
| `output/confounders.xlsx` (= root `confounders.xlsx`) | Number of confounders per dataset × miner |
| `output/{miner}/{dataset}/` | Full causal analysis report (Excel + PDF) per dataset |
